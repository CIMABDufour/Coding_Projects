Log Income and Expenses:

    Allow the user to add records for income (e.g., salary, freelance work) and expenses (e.g., rent, groceries).
    Each record should include a category (e.g., "Food," "Transport") and a date.

Summarize Finances:

  Display a summary of total income, expenses, and the current balance.

Category Breakdown:

  Show how much was spent in each category (e.g., "Food: $200, Transport: $50").

Saving Goals (Optional):

  Let the user set savings goals and track progress.

Stretch Goals (Advanced Features)

  Monthly Budget:

    Allow users to set a monthly budget and alert them when they're close to exceeding it.

  Recurring Transactions:

    Add recurring expenses or income (e.g., monthly salary or rent).

  Currency Conversion:

    Integrate an API to convert between currencies.

  User Authentication:

    Add simple user accounts to allow multiple users to manage their finances.
